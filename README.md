## Course - Sophomore 1 - Hardware Design Lab
- This repository contains all my exercises, assignments, and laboratory work from the Hardware Design Lab course during my sophomore year's first semester. 
- Three main folders: 
  - `roger`: my personal files
  - `johnny`: my teammate's personal files
  - `final`: all Lab files to be submitted
- Our entire Final Project has been moved to a dedicated Repository: [Project-Soph1-HDL-FPCAT](https://github.com/rogerfan48/Project-Soph1-HDL-FPCAT)
